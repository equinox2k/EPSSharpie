	/// There are three basic types of operators:
	/// 
	/// (1) operators which use reflection and invoke
	///     a static method on some class by passing the
	///     interpreter object as a parameter.
	/// (2) operators which keep an opcode and use a
	///     switch block to select the proper method.
	/// (3) operators which directly overwrite the exec
	///     method.
	/// 
	/// Implementing all operators like (1) makes the interpreter
	/// about 40% slower on average.
	/// Implementing all operators like (3) makes the jar file
	/// more then twice as big and (2) is a good compromise between
	/// code size and speed.
	/// 
	/// Frequently used operators should use (3). Heavy operators
	/// performing quite a bit of work should use (1). There are
	/// some operators like "if" which have to be implemented using (1),
	/// because the name is a Java key word.
